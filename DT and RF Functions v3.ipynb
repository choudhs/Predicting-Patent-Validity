    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the idea behind this project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project aims to build a tool that verifies if legal patents are valid or not\n",
    "\n",
    "> We determine if a patent is valid or not based on the Eligibility 101 Abstractness law.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This was a supervised ML project\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why did I create this project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> I am in a club called SAAS (Student's Association for Applied Statistics) at Berkeley, particularly the Data Consulting team. We work with clients on statistical modeling, data science/ ML/ NLP, and CV projects. Last semester, my team and I worked with a client called AiLanthus, an insurance and litigation startup to create the aforementioned tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The reason for the tool was because validating patents is quite a time sink for examiners, and because of the high volume of patents to check they are often not checked thoroughly enough. The business value behind our model is to make the patent validation process more thorough, accurate, efficient, and time sensitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We all worked individually or in pairs on different phases of the deliverable. Before this phase, which I created, we downloaded data from the USPTO website and used 2 APIs (google__patent__scraper and Aylien) to scrape patents for patent data, features such as examiner rates collection, forward and backward citations, number of said count, and finally for patent themes such as automobile, piracy, internet, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our team did some research and decided that these were important features to collect because they helped to gauge patent validity, based on patents that were previously marked valid\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What phase did I work on?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> I used the features we engineered and created two layers of our multi-layer ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What were the other phases of the project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Other phases that I worked on with my teammates included feature engineering by vectorizing words using Law2Vec, EDA, PCA, statistical tests on the features to determine which ones are the most insightful, LDA, data balancing, forward feature subset selection, LSTMs, and combining all the pieces into a pipeline for our client to run locally\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why am I presenting this project to you?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project was incredibly interesting and I feel that it is representative of the fields I'd like to explore at Stripe (ML) and my skill set!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What did I learn?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are several reasons! At a personal/technical level, this project was my first introduction to NLP. I learned about important packages for NLP-related work and sklearn, relevant EDA techniques, feature engineering, LDA, PCA, and creating decision trees, random forests, and LSTMs\n",
    "\n",
    "> This was not a class project so we had minimal direction. I learned how to quickly brainstorm ideas for every phase, create a ML model from scratch, deeply investigate it to find where to iterate upon it, how to write code at a production-ready level, and how to combine our team's work into one package all in 10 weeks!\n",
    "\n",
    "> In terms of soft skills, I learned about how to take a challenging abstract idea and make it objective and programmable. I also learned how to present advanced technical work in a high-stakes setting to people with a nontechnical background so that they understand the business value of our work. Interns at Stripe would probably work in teams too so I pulled out this project to showcase my experience in programming with a team and how I learned to stitch our work together (ensemble method). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What was the outcome of this work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project went into our final pipeline which was exciting, but to get to this phase I had put in a lot of time and effort into a previous project (feature engineering using Law2Vec) which got completely scrapped. Learning how to rebound from that and still make my efforts worthwhile was a crucial lesson! \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What work from here is transferable to SWE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Web scraping and using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "> ML concepts and engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "> Creating a pipeline that is production-ready and user-friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "> Debugging and team programming\n",
    "\n",
    "> Increasing model's speed by hyperparameter tuning (reminds me of playing around with time complexity in different data structures)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Writing clean code with documentation for our client and testing our final pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using AWS to run and deploy our final models, as well as tracking our edits as primitive source control"

    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "- A random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. In splitting the tree, it searches for the best feature instead of the most important feature (based on something like least MSE) and thus only a random subset of features are considered when splitting the node\n",
    "- It was useful because after collecting all of our features, we were able to parse which ones were the most important and how many we needed for max eval. metrics\n",
    "- This worked for my purposes to drop unimportant featuers, reduce variance, and generalize on new datasets better than DTs\n",
    "- While I did use a Decision Tree as well, I didn't try a logistic regression because I was looking for a categorical/discrete output rather than a numerical value.\n",
    "- A disadvantage of RFs can be the time it takes to run them, but I didn't encounter that problem here\n",
    "- What is the difference b/w a DT and RF? A DT comes up with 1 way to predict the class of a label whereas RF uses several DTs all with different approaches to classifying the label, and then averages the results for a better result\n",
    "- Some issues I had was during hyperparameter tuning, deciding how big the parameters should be without getting too much variance, and this I troubleshooted with my PM\n",
    "- I learned about implementing a RF through teammates' skeleton code, towardsdatascience, medium, and other internet articles"

    "- Cross validation is used to understand how well our model is/will generalize when it sees new data\n",

In this case, we divide the data into k subsets, leaving one of the k subsets as our testing sets and the remaining k - 1 subsets as our training set, and then the error estimation is averaged over all k trials to get the accuracy of our model. \n",
    "- It is useful because this is a common approach for validation, and it reduces bias because we most of the data for fitting the model, and reduces variance because most of the data also goes into the test set\n",
    "- This worked for my purposes to mitigate over-fitting (which we didn't actually see here) and is good practice when hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Other things I could've tried are the holdout method (k=1-fold cross val, not exhaustive enough for the technical requirements of this project) or stratified k-fold (when there is an imbalance in the dataset so each fold contains the same percentage of valid and invalid patents)\n",
    "- Some issues I had were understanding what bias and variance are, and for this I chatted with a teammate who explained the concepts to me and how they could be observed in our project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on bias and variance\n",
    "- Bias is an error made by the model when it makes incorrect assumptions in its classification algorithm. High bias can cause an algorithm to omit key relationships between the features and its output (i.e. underfitting)\n",
    "- Variance is the variability in the model's output for a certain datapoint fed in. High variance can mean the model is poor at generalizing (i.e. overfitting)\n",
    "- High bias, low variance: model is consistent but inaccurate on average\n",
    "- High bias, high variance: model is inaccurate and also inconsistent on average\n",

    "- A decision tree is similar to a random forest, except each branch/decision being made considers all the features inputted instead of picking the best ones based on a certain measure. The decision algorithm is the same for every branch too, unlike a random forest where it changes based on the features and then final result is an average of the previous decisions made. \n",
    "- This was useful to get a baseline for how a tree structure would suit our dataset and how effective it'd be in classifying patents. \n",
    "- This worked for my purposes because I did not perform any initial feature selection and wanted to try out all the features first, DTs are quite interpretable compared to a random forest, and they perform well on the training set\n",
    "- After trying a RF and DT, I didn't investigate with a KNN classifier, SVM, or boosted or bagged DTs\n",
    "- Disadvantages of DTs are the high likelihoods of overfitting, high bias, and high variance\n",
    "- Some issues I had was understanding the tradeoffs between RFs and DTs and for this I spoke to my teammates and browsed articles on the web. I also spoke to my PM who ultimately informed me that trying both models would be beneficial.\n",

    "- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is a statistical technique for increasing the number of cases in your dataset in a balanced way. This technique generates synthetic (\"fake\") data points from the minority class (in this case the invalid patents) to balance our dataset out\n",
    "- It was useful for increasing our model evaluation metrics\n",
    "- The purpose behind this was to avoid skewing our classification results and try to give our model a dataset with a more even portion of valid and invalid patents\n",
    "- I used SMOTE rather than Random Oversampling because I wanted to create more diversity in the training set, and I also used SMOTE rather than the NearMiss algorithm too because I wanted to prevent information loss and preserve the amount of data we had in our training set (which is already not that much)\n",
    "- A disadvantage of SMOTE is that it can create additional noise that affects the model's generalizability because it does not consider neighboring examples from other classes\n",
    "- Some issues I had was understanding exactly what SMOTE does and what it means by synthetic data points\n",
    "- I learned about implementing SMOTE through an article a teammate sent me, linked above"
